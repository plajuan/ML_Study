The use of this data in the construction of models implies a model **training process**, where machine learning algorithms search for patterns that make it possible to make predictions in future situations with similar characteristics.\n",

Sometimes, the best way to learn a particular subject (e.g., solving quadratic equations) is to see several solved exercises in order to detect the pattern used in the solution. It is the same for machine learning: algorithms use data to determine existing patterns and build prediction models.\n",

        "In the previous chapter, **after encoding the categorical variables**, we ended up with the following correspondences:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Variable 'Colour'\n",
        "  *   yellow = 0\n",
        "  *   red = 2\n",
        "  *   green = 1\n",
        "*   Variable 'Size'\n",
        "  *   L = 2\n",
        "  *   M = 1\n",
        "  *   S = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "As we indicated, there is an important difference between these two categorical variables: the variable 'Colour' is nominal and the variable 'Size' is ordinal. With this being the case, our encoding system has a **problem**. Although the variable 'Colour' is not ordinal, the algorithm will assume that `red > green > yellow`, just as it assumes that `L > M > S` (according to the integers that represent each of these categories). This situation means that, under certain circumstances, the algorithms do not work correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way around this problem is to use **one-hot encoding**. One-hot encoding involves creating a variable (column) for each existing category, attributing the value 1 or 0 to the observation in that variable, depending on whether or not the observation belongs to the category in question. For example, if a given observation refers to a yellow blouse, one-hot encoding will make it so that this observation will have the properties `yellow = 1`, `red = 0` and `green = 0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "One-hot encoding is applied through the *scikit-learn* library using the `OneHotEncoder` class, just as described in the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html?highlight=one hot encoder#sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, because it is simpler, let us illustrate how to do one-hot encoding via an alternative route, using the `get_dummies` function from the *pandas* library:\n",

For example, if we want to predict the species of a plant based on the size of its petals, the petal size is an independent variable.

        "*   ***Scikit-learn* library**. The *scikit-learn* library has a set of features related to the application of machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "*   **Pre-processing**. Before using learning algorithms, it is necessary to ensure that the data is prepared for their application. Therefore, it is common to perform pre-processing operations such as encoding categorical variables, defining independent and dependent variables, and separating the dataset into a training dataset and a test dataset.\n",
        "*   **Model training with machine learning**. Model training follows a standard structure. The aspects that differ are related to the definition of the algorithm we want to use (in this course, we always use the *Random Forest* algorithm) and whether we intend to use the version for classification problems (in the case of *Random Forest* this would mean using the `RandomForestClassifier` class) or for regression problems (in the case of *Random Forest* this would mean using the `RandomForestRegressor` class).\n",

        "This tutorial presented various instructions and you are not expected to know them by heart. Above all, the purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate the **potential of the *scikit-learn* library** and to **serve as a document for future reference**. Later, with practice, you will begin to retain the instructions that you use most often and the logic behind each instruction will become more intuitive."
