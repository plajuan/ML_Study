        "Many of the applications of supervised learning are geared towards making **predictions**. These predictions may be different in nature but, in general, they seek to anticipate what will happen through pattern recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the fourth step in solving problems with machine learning is to understand how good the prediction models are. For this, it is necessary to **evaluate the performance of the models**, to determine whether they have any practical use.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can draw an **analogy** between evaluating the performance of models and what we do when studying for a test. When we are studying for a test, we try to solve exercises similar to those that will appear on the test in order to understand whether or not we are prepared. In machine learning it is the same: before we can say that a model is good, we have to test and evaluate it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will introduce you to some aspects of model evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Evaluation metrics**. There are several metrics that can be used to assess machine learning models.\n",
        "*   **Cross-validation**. These techniques allow us to get a better estimate of the predictive capacity of the models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tutorial has several **examples** that demonstrate how code is applied and its effects. In addition, during the tutorial you will encounter various challenges to check whether you understand the material. At the end, all of the content presented will be summarised.\n",

        "\n",
        "Choosing an evaluation metric to determine a model's performance **depends on the problem we are solving**. For example, if we are developing a model to detect serious illnesses, it is preferable to identify all patients with a serious illness, even if this means making some incorrect predictions (and thereby reducing the success rate). Any other solution could lead to a person who is ill not receiving the necessary treatment (which could have serious consequences). Therefore, we can see that there are situations where, given the nature of the problem, the success rate is not the best evaluation metric for performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "To make the concepts easier to understand, we will analyse performance evaluation metrics by considering **two-class classification problems** (binary classification). In this type of problem, it is common to use the terms ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ to describe the two existing classes. For example, if the problem is to predict which students will pass at the end of the year, we say that a student is classified as 'positive' if the model predicts that they will pass. Conversely, a student is classified as 'negative' if the model predicts that they will fail at the end of year.\n",

        "*   `from.sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier` and `model = RandomForestClassifier()` are instructions that we are already familiar with and that are related to the construction of the model using the Random Forest algorithm.\n",
        "*   `scores` is the variable where we will store the estimates of the model's performance.\n",
        "*   `cross_val_score(model, X, y)` is the function that performs cross-validation.\n",

        "  *   The third parameter (`y`) refers to the dependent variable.\n",

        "So, as we can see, one of the main differences here is that when using the `cross_val_score()` function, we no longer need to explicitly split the original dataset into a training dataset (`X_train`) and test dataset (`X_test`). This process is done automatically by the `cross_val_score()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the benefits of using *k*-fold cross-validation is that we get **more reliable estimates** of the performance of our models. *K*-fold cross-validation runs various simulations where it applies the model to different datasets, thereby giving us a more complete insight into the model's behaviour. Therefore our confidence in the model's performance is greater.\n",

        "Going back to the **test analogy**, below we can see the difference between the performance evaluation methodology that was previously applied and the methodology based on the use of *k*-fold cross-validation:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Previously applied methodology**. This methodology corresponds to studying for a test and, during our studying, doing **a test** from previous years whose result we can use as an estimate of the mark we will get on the test for which we are studying.\n",

        "\n",
        "Because it has a greater number of simulations, the methodology based on *k*-fold cross-validation is more robust and we are more confident in the estimate of the mark we will get.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to increasing the confidence of the estimates of models' performance, using *k*-fold cross-validation also provides us with **information about how sensitive the model is** to changes in the training and test datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an **example**, we will use two classification models whose success rate estimates were obtained using cross-validation with k=5 iterations, as described in the following table:\n",

This means that the model would have no way of knowing the characteristics of an observation from the 'virginica' class and, therefore, it would have no way of predicting a new observation as belonging to the 'viginica' class. This situation would also occur for the remaining iterations, which would make us believe that it would be impossible to create a prediction model to solve the problem.

For example, if 70% of our observations are from the 'versicolor' class and 30% are from the 'virginica' class, then stratified cross-validation ensures that each of the *k* parts has 70% of its observations from the 'versicolor' class and 30% from the 'virginica' class.\n",

However for regression problems it is customary to use *k*-fold cross-validation because the issue of differences in the proportion of observations does not factor into these problems.\n",
