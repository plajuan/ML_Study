        "\n",
        "In the real world, most of the machine learning problems that we are going to solve involve using data that is **already stored somewhere**. For example, if we want to create machine learning models to predict the weather, what we will most likely have to do is import data from a database. Fortunately, it is very unlikely that we will have to enter all of the data ourselves, observation by observation, just as we did to illustrate the concepts behind the *Series* and *DataFrame* data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data we plan to import can be saved in **different formats**. One of the most common storage formats is the CSV (*Comma-Separated Values*) file.\n",
        "\n",
        "In **CSV files**, data is stored according to the following rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Existing fields are identified in the first row.\n",
        "*   In the remaining rows, the values for each observation are described in the fields previously identified.\n",
        "*   Fields and values are separated by commas (which explains the logic behind the name *Comma-Separated Values*).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in a CSV file, the data that makes up the *DataFrame* `responses` seen earlier, would be presented as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "`Yes, No`\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "`56, 44`\n",
        "\n",
        "Visually there is a significant difference between organising data in a *DataFrame* and organising it in a CSV file. However, computationally, there is no difference. All that matters to the computer is that the data is organised in a **consistent** manner and according to **logic** that it is already familiar with.\n",
        "\n",
        "The *pandas* library allows us to enable our computer to read CSV files. For that, all we have to do is import *pandas* and use the `pd.read_csv ()` function which converts data from a CSV file to a *DataFrame*. This function can accept several types of arguments, one of which is the file’s location. The rest of the arguments can be found in the [official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html?highlight=read_csv#pandas.read_csv).\n",

        "*   The ***Pandas* library**. The *pandas* library has a set of features that allow us to prepare and analyse data.\n",
        "*   **Data structures**. *Pandas* uses two types of data structures, *Series* and *DataFrames*.\n",
        "*   *Data import*. Data can be stored in files, such as CSV files, and it is possible to use *pandas* to import this data.\n",
        "*   **Missing data**. The problem of missing data can be solved by eliminating data or imputing data.\n",
        "*   **Other data preparation operations**. Data selection can be done in several ways, depending on what you want to do. With *pandas* it is also possible to assign, group, sort and remove data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial introduced several instructions and you are not expected to know them by heart. Above all, this tutorial intends to illustrate the **potential of the *pandas* library** and to serve as a **document for future reference**. Later, with practice, you will begin to retain the instructions that you use most often and the logic behind each instruction becomes more intuitive."
